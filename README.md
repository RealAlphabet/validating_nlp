## What is this ?

This repo contains an approach to validate whatever output the AI gives to the user using AI itself.

In the near future, I picture AI cross-validating themselves to make sure that any bot has the expected behavior and does not harm a human. Please check out the code and comment fork raise issues etc. ! Opening a GitHub Discussions panel...

<!-- ! even the most elaborate test is just a demo, don't push the code as is in production -->

## Prerequisites

- NodeJS >=18.x.x
- a standard Docker Desktop installation

## Contribution guidelines

Dear past, present, and future contributors, you have my many thanks, but please follow these guidelines:

- please use comments to explain your code, even if it's obvious to you, it might not be to someone else
- you are free to arrange the code, the folder structure, the file names, etc. as you see fit if you're able to provide a good reason for it

That's all, thank you for your time !
